TypeScript common helpers and core library

```bash
yarn add @lcdev/ts@0.2
```

This library has some disjointed exported types that all have been found useful in multiple projects.
Very similar to other typescript utility libraries out there, but it's nice to have control over our own.

Most common types that we use:

- `Json`
- `Merge<A, B>`
- `NonOptional<Obj, Keys>`
- `AllNonOptionl<Obj>`
- `DeepPartial<T>`
- `Option<T>`
- `Result<T, Err>`
- `Nullable`
- `ReturnType<Func>`
- `Class<T>`
